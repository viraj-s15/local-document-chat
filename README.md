I really like the original project and but the last commit on it was 2 months ago. I needed to use this project but was facing a few problems:

- Python Dependency issues
- Kubernetes deployment not working properly
- Uploading certain large pdfs caused issues
- I wanted it to integrate with supabase

I will not be maintaining this so use it if youre ready to make some changes

Exactly these instructions can be used to run the ui locally.
